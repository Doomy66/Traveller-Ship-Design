# Ship catalogue sources

These designs come from Mainline's `ships/` folder. They were built there with a copy of this designer's engine, and are the same `.ship` files the application saves.

Every design is built under Mongoose *High Guard Update 2022*, and `catalogue.test.ts` checks that each one opens with no errors. The published figures set the tonnage, drives, armament and role. The rest (power plant, fuel, bridge, computer, sensors, staterooms, cargo) is filled in to make a legal HG2022 design. Cargo is whatever tonnage is left over, so it often differs from the source. The crew is what the HG2022 crew table gives, which can be well above the source's figure on heavily armed ships. Where a source carries marines or troops, barracks or double-occupancy staterooms are added for them.

The four High Guard ships that reproduce their printed sheets exactly (the Scout/Courier, the Free Trader, the Patrol Corvette and the Destroyer Escort) are not here. They are the tested fixtures in `src/fixtures/`.

The descriptions in each design's notes are summaries written for the catalogue, not text from the sources.

## Changed on the way in

Two things were changed when the files were copied from Mainline. Neither moves a ton.

- **Repeated craft became one line.** The Arakoine's hundred fighters were a hundred craft lines, and the Azhanti's sixty were sixty. Identical craft are now one line with a number (ShipSpec 4.11.3.1). Tonnage, price and crew are exactly what they were.
- **Craft priced from another design's sheet now use its full price.** Mainline priced a carried Kia, Rampart, modular cutter, pinnace or ship's boat at that design's standard design price. The carrying ship's own discount then took 10% off again (ShipSpec 4.11.3.2). Those craft now cost the design's total: Kia Heavy Fighter MCr36.285, Rampart Light Fighter MCr14.108, Modular Cutter MCr18.19, Pinnace MCr15.66, Ship's Boat MCr11.59, Snub MCr7.66. Craft at a printed or assumed price are unchanged.

## Sources

| Ship | File | Source | Original edition | Liberties taken |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Rampart Light Fighter | Rampart-Light-Fighter.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Rampart_class_Light_Fighter | Classic (High Guard) | The source lists no weapons; one fixed pulse laser added. |
| Kia Heavy Fighter | Kia-Heavy-Fighter.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Kia_class_Heavy_Fighter | Classic (FASA ACS vol. 1) | The source mentions a fusion gun and missiles; set as one single turret of each on its two firmpoints. Armour 12 stands in for "heavily armoured". |
| Ship's Boat | Ships-Boat.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Ship%27s_Boat | Classic | TL raised from 9 to 12 because Thrust 6 needs TL12 under HG2022. Acceleration seats added for passengers. |
| Pinnace | Pinnace.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Pinnace | Classic | TL raised from 9 to 11 because Thrust 5 needs TL11. One pulse laser turret, as the source typically fits. |
| Modular Cutter | Modular-Cutter.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Modular_Cutter | Classic | The 30-ton module is modelled as a 60% modular hull, with the module bay counted in cargo. |
| Dragon System Defence Boat | Dragon-System-Defence-Boat.ship | Mongoose Traveller High Guard Update 2022, p.193 | Mongoose 2e | Close: TL13, 400 t, Thrust 7, crystaliron 13, 2 particle barbettes, small missile bay, point defence laser Type II, 480 missiles. The book shrinks the missile bay by customisation; built here at full size, and Intellect left out for want of bandwidth. |
| Flare Gunboat | Flare-Gunboat.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Flare_class_Gunboat | Fan design (Classic High Guard) | TL raised from 10 to 12 because Thrust 6 and plasma guns need it. Armour raised from 1 to 8. |
| Express Boat | Express-Boat.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Type_X_class_Express_Boat | Classic (Traders and Gunboats) | Given a small fusion plant (HG2022 needs one to jump). 3 staterooms because HG2022 crews it with 3. |
| Far Trader | Far-Trader.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Type_A2_class_Far_Trader | Classic / Mongoose | Built at TL12. One double turret (pulse laser and sandcaster) on a hardpoint the source leaves empty. |
| Subsidised Merchant | Subsidised-Merchant.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Type_R_class_Subsidized_Merchant | Classic / T5 | Built at TL12. Two double turrets on hardpoints the source leaves empty. |
| Subsidised Liner | Subsidised-Liner.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Type_M_class_Subsidized_Liner | Classic / T5 | Built at TL12. Close translation otherwise; unarmed as in the source. |
| Yacht | Yacht.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Type_Y_class_Yacht | Classic (FASA ACS vol. 2) | Kept at the source's TL9. The owner's suite is one luxury stateroom. Extra fuel for a second jump. |
| Safari Ship | Safari-Ship.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Type_K_class_Safari_Ship | Classic | Built at TL11. The double turret the source leaves empty gets a pulse laser and a sandcaster. Capture tanks are a custom 14-ton system. |
| Seeker Mining Ship | Seeker-Mining-Ship.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Type_J_class_Seeker | Classic / T5 | Built at TL11 (lowest TL with jump-2). The mining laser is a laser drill, sharing a double turret with a sandcaster. |
| Laboratory Ship | Laboratory-Ship.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Type_L_class_Laboratory_Ship | Classic | Dispersed structure hull, as in HG2022. Close translation otherwise. |
| Mercenary Cruiser | Mercenary-Cruiser.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Type_C_class_Mercenary_Cruiser | Classic | The source has 8 bare hardpoints; 4 get a double turret (beam laser and sandcaster). The ATVs ride inside the cutter modules and are not listed. |
| Corsair | Corsair.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Type_P_class_Corsair | Classic (T5 wiki figures) | Uses the original 400-ton hull rather than T5's 440, at TL12. The four beam lasers go in 4 double turrets, each also carrying a sandcaster. Boarding pinnace, breaching tube and brig added. |
| Leviathan Merchant Cruiser | Leviathan-Merchant-Cruiser.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Leviathan_class_Merchant_Cruiser | Classic | Close translation. HG2022's smaller drives leave about 370 tons of cargo against the source's 70. |
| Hydrogen Fleet Tanker | Hydrogen-Fleet-Tanker.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Hydrogen_class_Fleet_Fuel_Tanker | Fan design (Classic High Guard) | Kept at TL9. Cargo fuel is extra fuel tankage (about 3,300 tons in all). UNREP system added. HG2022 wants a gunner per turret, so it has more crew than the source. |
| Donosev Survey Scout | Donosev-Survey-Scout.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Donosev_class_Survey_Scout | Classic (Fighting Ships) | The spare cutter module is a custom 30-ton system. Survey sensors (shallow penetration, mineral, life scanner, probe drones) stand in for the source's unspecified survey fit. |
| Gazelle Close Escort | Gazelle-Close-Escort.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Gazelle_class_Close_Escort | Classic / Mongoose HG2022 | Follows the HG2022 400-ton layout (Thrust 5 sized for 420 tons, jump-5 drive fuelled for jump-3, budget plant and drive), with CT's 2 particle barbettes and 2 triple beam laser turrets. The drop tank itself is a custom zero-ton line because it hangs outside the hull. |
| Kinunir Battle Cruiser | Kinunir-Battle-Cruiser.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Kinunir_class_Battle_Cruiser | Classic | The CT 35-ton pinnace becomes the standard 40-ton one. "Dual lasers" become double beam laser turrets. Nuclear damper and black globe kept. |
| Broadsword Mercenary Cruiser | Broadsword-Mercenary-Cruiser.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Broadsword_class_Mercenary_Cruiser | Classic | Close translation. A sphere hull (the source's spheroid, unstreamlined). Berths for a 20-strong mercenary platoon. |
| Musuna Frigate | Musuna-Frigate.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Musuna_class_Frigate | Fan design (Classic High Guard) | Kept at TL11. The missile bay is a medium bay. Drop tanks replaced by internal fuel for a second jump-2. 162 marines in barracks. |
| Hyperion Escort Carrier | Hyperion-Escort-Carrier.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Hyperion_class_Escort_Carrier | Fan design (Classic High Guard) | Kept at TL9, so the beam laser turrets become pulse lasers (HG2022 puts beam lasers at TL10). The ten 20-ton snub fighters are this catalogue's Snub. |
| Shibash Light Cruiser | Shibash-Light-Cruiser.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Shibash_class_Light_Cruiser | GURPS Traveller: Interstellar Wars | Kept at TL11, so the weapons are swapped for ones HG2022 allows there: 2 small particle bays for the 100-ton particle bay, 2 plasma barbettes for the plasma bay, a Type I point defence laser for the repulsor. Extra fuel for a second jump. |
| Gionetti Light Cruiser | Gionetti-Light-Cruiser.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Gionetti_class_Light_Cruiser | Classic (Fighting Ships) | The meson spinal mount takes 60 of the 300 hardpoints, so the 200 triple missile turrets become 150 turrets plus 5 small missile bays. The 100-ton repulsor is a medium repulsor bay. No armour, as in the source. |
| Arakoine Strike Cruiser | Arakoine-Strike-Cruiser.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Arakoine_class_Strike_Cruiser | Classic (Fighting Ships) | Military hull and bonded superdense armour 6 (the source gives none). The 100 heavy fighters are priced as this catalogue's Kia heavy fighter. Two launch tubes. |
| Azhanti High Lightning Frigate | Azhanti-High-Lightning-Frigate.ship | https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Lightning_class_Frontier_Cruiser | Classic (AHL / Supplement 5) | Built at TL14, so no black globe (HG2022 TL15). Meson spinal mount at one multiple (the CT factor-N mount would not fit alongside full jump-5 fuel). The four 400-ton fuel shuttles are carried at an assumed MCr90 each. 150 marines in barracks. |
| FOO3 | FOO3.ship | Steve Burrows, made in the Traveller Ship Designer | Mongoose 2e | Own design: a 300-ton TL16 special-operations ship. |
| Maul-class Bombardment Ship | Maul-class-Bombardment-Ship.ship | Steve Burrows, made in the Traveller Ship Designer | Mongoose 2e | Own design: 2,000 tons, orbital strike mass driver and meson bays for bombardment. |
| Roam Pod | Roam-Pod.ship | Steve Burrows, made in the Traveller Ship Designer | Mongoose 2e | Own design: a 50-ton private runabout. |
| Tern-class Fighter Carrier | Tern-class-Fighter-Carrier.ship | Steve Burrows, made in the Traveller Ship Designer | Mongoose 2e | Own design: 5,000 tons, two squadrons of twelve Wasp heavy fighters. |
| Wasp Heavy Fighter | Wasp-Heavy-Fighter.ship | Steve Burrows, made in the Traveller Ship Designer | Mongoose 2e | Own design: the Tern's 40-ton strike fighter. |
| Snub | Snub.ship | Steve Burrows, made in the Traveller Ship Designer | Mongoose 2e | Own design: a 20-ton TL9 fighter. Thrust 1 is all a TL9 manoeuvre drive gives, so a reaction booster adds thrust 5 for two hours of combat. |
| Snub 2 | Snub-2.ship | Steve Burrows, made in the Traveller Ship Designer | Mongoose 2e | Own design: the Snub rebuilt at TL12, with a thrust 6 manoeuvre drive and crystaliron. |

## Assumed craft prices

The 20-ton launch (MCr3.6), 20-ton gig (MCr5.5), 95-ton shuttle (MCr25) and 400-ton fuel shuttle (MCr90) have no design here, and their prices are assumed. The Hyperion's snub fighters were assumed at MCr8 until the Snub was designed; they now cost its MCr7.66.
